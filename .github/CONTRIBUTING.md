# Contributing

First of all, thank you for contributing, you're awesome!

## Reporting Bugs

If you happen to find a bug, we kindly request you to report it. However, before submitting it, please:

* Check the project documentation available in the projet

Then, if it appears that it's a real bug, you may report it using GitHub by following these 3 points:

* Check if the bug is not already reported!
* A clear title to resume the issue
* A description of the workflow needed to reproduce the bug

> _NOTE:_ Don't hesitate giving as much information as you can (OS, language version used for projet, choice brower used and this version...)

## Pull Requests

* You add valid test cases.
* Tests are green.
